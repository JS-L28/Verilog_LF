LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell CR1/CRC_reg[63]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CR1/CRC_reg[54]/PRE, CR1/CRC_reg[55]/PRE, CR1/CRC_reg[56]/PRE,
CR1/CRC_reg[57]/CLR, CR1/CRC_reg[58]/PRE, CR1/CRC_reg[59]/PRE,
CR1/CRC_reg[5]/PRE, CR1/CRC_reg[60]/PRE, CR1/CRC_reg[61]/CLR,
